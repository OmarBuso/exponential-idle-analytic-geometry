# Analytic Geometry: Custom Theory for Exponential Idle

This is a Custom Theory for the game Exponential Idle, based on concepts from analytic geometry, featuring coordinate functions, distance and magnitude formulas, and a variety of upgrades that affect how fast you generate œÅ over time

## Features

Custom formulas for X(x), Y(x), and Z(x)
Distance and sum-based calculation using d(x) and z(x)
Variable upgrades with milestone branching
Visual LaTeX equations and progressive complexity

## Initial Formula
\dot{\rho} = q_1 sqrt[2.4n]{\prod_{i=1}^n( d(i) \cdot z(i) \cdot q_2)}

Where:
d(x) = \sqrt{X(x)^2 + Y(x)^2}
z(x) = |X(x)| + |Y(x)|

## How to Use

1. Open the file "AnalyticGeometry.js"
2. Press the button "Raw" that appears above the code
3. Copy the link of the raw code
4. In-game, access the custom theory screen using the arrows on the bottom until you reach a screen saying "Tap to select a custom theory". Enter the menu and press the "+" button
5. Finally, paste the URL of this Custom Theory and click "Download"
